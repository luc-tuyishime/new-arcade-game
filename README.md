For this game you can realize that there are three different part in the canvas which are first the grass, second the stones and third the water block and the player is in his position inside the grass and enemies are inside the stones and nothings inside the water, so the main goal of the player is to reach  the water by traversing the stones without making any collision with the enemies or if the collision is made the player restart the again the game means come to the his first part (the grass). when the player reach the water by making no collision the ennemies increase randomly meaning they multiply.The player can move right , left , up and down. By reaching to the water by the player mean the player won the game and the score increase same to the level. More the level increase more its becoming hard.
